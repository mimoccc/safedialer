If You have problem to download application follow instructions bellow:

You can download the latest **SafeDialer** Android application (APK file) directly also 
from the build artifacts of our continuous integration system.

Follow these steps:

1.  Navigate to the [**GitHub Actions page for the SafeDialer repository**](${{ site.github.repository_url }}/actions).
2.  Look for the **latest successful workflow run**, usually corresponding to the most recent changes in the `main` branch.
3.  On the summary page for that run, scroll down to the "**Artifacts**" section.
4.  Download the artifact named `app-build`. This is typically a ZIP archive containing the APK file(s).

This ensures you always get the most up-to-date version built directly from the source code.
